EmojiBot
========

EmojiBot very simply converts a certain range of the Supplementary Multilingual Plane [-cough- emojis]  into a readable format for use in IRC. 

A Note on Node v0.8
=========
Emojibot depends on the IRC node package, consequently it requires node v0.8 to properly connect to servers that require passphrases.
